Cloud computing has been the latest trend in IT-Outsourcing. Many old and existing technologies were renamed in order to be part of it. Due to this, it became difficult to determine what is really ''new'' in cloud computing. The actual invention is the dynamic scaling aspect of delivered services. The payment scheme remains, ''pay-per-use''. \cite{Boehm2011}


(1) loss of direct control of resources and software, e.g., website infrastructure and operations staff for CloudRetail, 

(2) increased liability risk due to security breaches and data leaks as a result of using shared external resources, 

(3) decreased reliability since the service providers may go out of business, causing business continuity and data recovery issues, and 

(4) SaaS solutions are mainly built as one-size-fits-all customers, although there are sometimes add-ons to complement the functionality. CloudRetail is limited to the functionality offered by the SaaS proivders and it is hard to customize solutions based on its needs.



Difficult questions to answer for CloudRetail are 
(1) which functions to move to the cloud in what order, 

(2) how to ensure a smooth migration process given legacy applications in their environment, and 

(3) how to find and select service offerings that meet their requirements and establish seamless interoperation between services.
