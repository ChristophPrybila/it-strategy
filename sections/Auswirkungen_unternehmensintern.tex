The social media property
on the web is exploding and fast
becoming a necessary part of
the arsenal of any organization.

 many organizations
are asking are â€œcan we monetize
social media in business€ and
â€œis the risk worth the gain?


Consumers now expect companies
to have a social media
presence. 


 But how does an
organization know how
to get involved and to
participateâ€”to lead or stay
out? 


Donâ€™t look at social media as
a mere add-on to your current
media offerings.\cite{Nair2011}
